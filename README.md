This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the development status (developed, developing, or under-developed) of countries using unsupervised learning algorithms. The project utilizes KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and pattern recognition.

The objective of this project is to categorize countries into development status groups based on various socio-economic indicators. Unsupervised learning algorithms are employed to identify patterns and group countries without using labeled data.

1) Exploring the dataset.
2) Data cleaning and preprocessing.
3) Applying KMeans clustering.
4) Applying hierarchical clustering.
5) Implementing Principal Component Analysis.

- **KMeans Clustering:** Divides countries into clusters based on similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Hierarchical grouping of countries based on similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality for better understanding of data patterns.
